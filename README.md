# ü§ñ Introduction

**Moleculyst** is a drug discovery and protein-binding prediction tool built with the latest in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) technology. Powered by NVIDIA NIM and protein structure prediction models, this project enables users to simulate molecular interactions and predict protein structures.

The platform is designed to help researchers accelerate drug discovery by leveraging cutting-edge AI models for protein folding, docking, and molecular dynamics.

## üß¨ Protein Data Processing

This section covers the protein data processing pipeline, including loading protein structure files (e.g., PDB format), performing molecular docking simulations, and visualizing the results.

### Protein Structure Input

Users can upload PDB files for protein structures, which will then be processed by NVIDIA NeMo's protein-folding models.
